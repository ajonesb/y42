# Y42 CSS Developer Test

Task: Please recreate the provided design responsive for desktop and mobile. You
can use any JS framework you’re familiar with to construct the project or simply
create an HTML and css/scss files.

You are encouraged to use Sass however please refrain from the use of external CSS libraries such as Bootstrap etc.

We value high attention to detail and clean, readable code. Please don’t worry
about any functionalities and interactions on the website, it’s enough to simply
develop a static page according to the design.

Implementing any effects on hover states will be a bonus, however since we don’t have a UX design at hand it will require some improvisation and hence is not required.

Inside the design file you will find all of the necessary specifications (such as font-
family, font-size, widths, height and paddings etc.) as well as visual elements you
can export to use in your project. Here’s a quick guide to exporting assets from
Figma.

In case of any questions or difficulties you can always reach out to Dawid -

Once you complete the test please send it to or share with the same email
address. 

On submission please specify how long did it take you to complete
the test.

## Development 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
